# Unity-Lightsabers
An experiment with unity lighting, 3D Modelling and terrain placement to create a Lightsaber! This experiment is just a playaround with HDRP, baked lighting and the Post Processing Stack V2. This was also my first time using Unity's Terrain 3D object, which allowed me to quickly build the forest environment around Vader, using assets from the Asset Store. The Darth Vader model was made in Blender following a Youtube tutorial, and the textures were taken from the same tutorial. It was rigged using Mixamo's automatic rigging system. The smoke is a combination of camera fog and a particle system using a custom material.

I might expand this project in the future to add a completely custom environment and animations for Vader
